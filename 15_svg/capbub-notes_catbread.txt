1.
Prediction: 
- a chart of names will be displayed on the webpage
- upon clicking the names, the clicky function will activate and show an alert of the selected name

Observations:
- a 2 x 3 chart is displayed
- names of Star Wars characters are in each box
- when clicking a name, an alert is displayed that simply says the name
- clicking surrounding area gives no effect

2.
Prediction: 
- a chart of names is displayed
- upon clicking the names, the clicky function activates and shows an alert of the selected name
- once it shows the name alert, it will activate the clicky function again and this time show the names in the same row

Observations:
- clicking a name shows an alert simply displaying the name
- after pressing ok on the alert, another alert pops up showing the row of names the name belongs to
- after pressing ok for that alert, a third alert pops up displaying all the names in the table

Comments:
- because there is an “addEventListener” for the whole table, clicking on the table shows the names in the entire table
- however, the alert displays the HTML that contains the names instead of only the names
- same for the when the alert displays the row of names

3. 
Prediction:
- when “stopPropagation” is commented out, the alerts will follow in the same order as the previous folder
- when “stopPropagation” is uncommented, the alert that displays all the names will pop out but the others will not show

Observations:
- when “stopPropagation” is commented out, the first alert that displays contains all the names, then the name selected, and then the row of names
-  when “stopPropagation” is uncommented, the alert that displays all the names popped out but the other alerts did not

Questions:
- how does adding a “true” result in an alert to be the first to pop out?
- how does adding a “true” make the alert an exception to the “stopPropagation”?

4.
Prediction:
- when “stopPropagation” is commented out, the alerts will pop out in the same order as in folder 2 (only the name, the row of names, all of the names)
- when “stopPropagation” is uncommented, the alerts will pop out in the same order as stated above

Observations:
- the order of the alerts goes backwards: all the names pop up, then the row of names, and then the selected name
- when “stopPropagation” is uncommented, only the alert with all the names pops up

Comments:
- it seems “true” reverses the order by giving priority to the latest clicked object
- because “stopPropagation” is after the alert function in the clicky function, one alert is able to pop up before the next one is prevented
